== Using .Net and MYSQL Template

:data-uri:

In this lab exercise we will learn how to use OpenShift Web Console to
spin up a MySQL database and .Net application using templates.
We can spin up both .Net and database tier at the same time. The .Net
application accesses this database using the service exposed by
the database. We will provide a route (a URL) to access the frontend
application from a browser.

*Step 1: Create a Project*

Based on the experience gained from the previous exercise, log into the
OpenShift Web Console. You will see the list of Projects.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

Using the *New Project* button, create a new project. We will call it
*dotnet-userxx*.
Type in a *Display Name* and *Description* of your choice.

Press the *Create* button to complete the project creation from the Web
Console. This will accomplish the same job as `oc new-project` from CLI.

*Step 2: Create a .Net application using the template*

Click on *Add to Project* button and you will be taken to select an
image or template. You will see the application create screen as shown
below:

In this lab exercise you have seen a complete web application deployed
using OpenShift templates. We are able to deploy application via templates.
Using template, we can capture all the information that it require to deploy
application in one step.
